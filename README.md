# POLYLINK Project

## Team:
SMINI AYMANE

## Technologies

Langagues : Javascript, html, css, java, SQL.
Frameworks: Angular, express js

# Database
For the database, I used XAMPP as a local server and MySQL for data storage. In MySQL, I created three tables: users_table, routes_table, and links_table. These tables were designed to manage and organize user information, routing data, and associated links effectively. This setup provided a reliable and efficient backend infrastructure for the application.

# Front-end
This project was developed using the Angular framework, leveraging TypeScript (TS) as the primary programming language. For the front-end design and user interface components, I utilized Angular Material, which provided a set of high-quality, customizable UI components that seamlessly integrate with Angular applications. This combination of Angular and Angular Material allowed for the creation of a robust, efficient, and visually appealing web application.

# Back-end
For the backend, I used the Express.js framework to create the APIs necessary for interacting with the database tables mentioned above. Express.js provided a flexible and efficient way to build the server-side logic and handle requests and responses for the `users_table`, `routes_table`, and `links_table`. This setup ensured seamless communication between the front end and the database, enabling efficient data management and retrieval.
